CSS
Describe the concept of specificity in CSS. How does it impact the application of styles, and how can you increase or decrease specificity?
- Specificity is a set of styling rules to see which styles should be applied to an element when two or more applied styles are in conflict. It resolves this by assigning hierachy. 
    - Rule selection 
        1) Type selectors - div, p
        2) Class selectors / Atribute selectors / Pseudo classes - classes, [type= "text"], :hover
            - 2 will override 1
        3) ID selectors
        4) Inline styles
        5) !important. This will override any declaration, but its use is not encourageed.
    - You can increase specificity by using more class and ID selectors. More attributes as well as pseudo classes especially inline styles if you are working in React.
    - You can descrease specificity by using less selectors and just sticking to class selectors with no inlines styling.

What is the CSS box-sizing property, and how does it affect the layout of elements on a webpage?
- The box-sizing property in CSS controls how the total width and height of an element are calculated.
    - content-box is the default layout, this includes only the width and height of the content and doesn't include padding or border. Those are added outside of content-box.
    - border-box not only include the width and height of the content but that of the padding and the border. What is not included is the margin.
- When you set the width and height to 'content-box' and add padding and/or border, the box is bigger than the properties you gave it, this gets complicated as the total space taken is not clear from the width and height alone, however
with 'border-box' the padding and border are added with the total space when width and height are set.
